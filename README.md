Nvidia Beta Vulkan
==================

This is just a mash of both the Nvidia Beta DKMS and Nvidia Vulkan projects from AUR. I've mashed them together as Nvidia has just released v470 of their drivers as beta. This brings a bunch of much awaited features including fixing xwayland. 

Credits to both authors of the original projects!
